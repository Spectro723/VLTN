# Walkthrough - Valentine's Proposal Page 💖

Your "Super Bonis" Valentine's request page is ready!

## 📂 Location
The file is located at:
`C:\Users\PC\.gemini\antigravity\scratch\valentine_proposal\index.html`

## 🎵 How to Add Your Music
1.  **Get your MP3**: Have your romantic song file ready (e.g., `cancion.mp3`).
2.  **Place the file**: Copy your MP3 file into the same folder as `index.html` (`valentine_proposal`).
3.  **Edit the code**:
    - Open `index.html` in a text editor (Notepad, VS Code, etc.).
    - Scroll down to the script section (around line 180).
    - Change `const CANCION_URL = 'pon_tu_link_aqui.mp3';` to the name of your file, e.g., `const CANCION_URL = 'cancion.mp3';`.
    - Adjust `START_TIME` and `END_TIME` if you want a specific part of the song to loop.

## ✨ Features Verification
- **Visuals**: Check the particle background and glassmorphism card.
- **Text**: Watch the text rotate through "pimpollo", "bombón", etc.
- **"No" Button**: Try to click the "No" button. It should jump away from your cursor or finger.
- **"Yes" Button**: Click "¡SÍ!" to see the confetti explosion and final message.
- **Music**: Click the 🔇 button to start the music loop (browser security requires interaction first).

## 🚀 How to Share
To send this to your Valentine:
-   **Option A (Simple)**: Send them the `index.html` file (and the music file) via email or WhatsApp (as a document).
-   **Option B (Better)**: Host it for free on **GitHub Pages** or **Netlify Drop** by dragging and dropping the folder. This generates a link you can send to their phone!
